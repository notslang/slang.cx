# How I do my Computing

I've been using [GNU/Linux](http://www.linux.org/) since around 2010, when I was a freshman in highschool, having switched over from Windows shortly after learning that Linux existed. I've tried to use other systems like OSX, but can't tolerate the lack of control over the OS, the inability to modify or redistribute the software, or the willingness Apple to spy on people who use their software. Systems like Plan 9, BSD, and Hurd seem fine, but I haven't worked with them enough to form an opinion.

My distro of choice right now is [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) because the minimalism and fine-grained control over package management is far more important than stability in my development environment. I've used various flavors of Debian in the past, but ended up modifying them to the point where it made more sense to start from scratch with a bare-bones system like Arch. On servers, I prefer [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) for its Docker integration, systemd-style management, and ease of provisioning clusters of machines. Debian-based systems are also quite nice on a server, but aren't as much fun as learning how to work with a cluster.
