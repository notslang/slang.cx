# Sean Lang

Hello! I'm Sean Lang, but most people call me slang. I spend my time working on software development and I am especially interested in data science.

## Contact Info

I respond quickest to email, so that is the best way to message me. My phone number should be avoided; I don't use it and both SMS & voicemail are forwarded to my email.
